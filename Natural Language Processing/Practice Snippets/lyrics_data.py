I love it when you call me Señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la

It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la (Yeah, no)

Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah

I love it when you call me Señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'

Ooh, you know I love it when you call me Señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la

'Cause you know it's been a long
Time coming, don't ya let me fall, ooh
Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly, don't stop

I love it when you call me Señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'

Ooh, you know I love it when you call me Señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

All along I've been coming for ya (For you)
And I hope it means something to you
Call my name, I'll be coming for ya (Coming for ya)
Coming for ya (Coming for ya)
For ya

For ya (Oh, she loves it when I come)
For ya
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?

We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd lie to you?

And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
I'm New York City, I'd still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love

I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah

Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love

You know I adore you
I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16

Lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens
Marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights

American glory
Faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless
Ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns
I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (ah)

No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

It's you and me
That's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games
You win stupid prizes
It's you and me
There's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

My team is losing
Battered and bruising
I see the high fives
Between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung
You are the only one
Who seems to care

American stories
Burning before me
I'm feeling helpless
The damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then
Where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (ah)

No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

It's you and me
That's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games
You win stupid prizes
It's you and me
There's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

And I don't want you to (go)
I don't really wanna (fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (win)
I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (go)
I don't really wanna (fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (win)
I think you should come home

And I don't want you to (go)
I don't really wanna (fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (win)
I just think you should know
And I'll never let you (go)
'Cause I know this is a (fight)
That someday we're gonna (win)

It's you and me
That's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
Oh, I just thought you should know
You should know

It's you and me
There's nothing like this (like this)
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue (paint it blue)
Voted most likely to run away with you

And I don't want you to (go)
I don't really wanna (fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (win)
I think you should come home
And I'll never let you (go)

That one day we're gonna (win)
I just think you should know
