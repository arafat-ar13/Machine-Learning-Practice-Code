I created a personal Bag of Words model of Taylor Swift's latest album released in 2019, Lover (I know we are all exicited!)

The lyrics getter Python file gets the lyrics of all the Lover songs from Genius and then keeps them in "lyrics.txt". To see the BoW model, simply run bag_of_words_model.py
And the "chunked_noun_phrases.py" gives a chunk of all the Noun Phrases Taylor's used in her latest album. 

Lastly, don't forget to buy, stream and download Lover!
